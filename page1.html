<pre>One night late into an intense study sesh at Stevenson Library you realize...
it's even quieter than usual. That's weird.

You look around to find that you are the only one left.
The librarian must have missed you on her way out.

You check your phone to figure out the time and...oh...it's dead.
Glancing up, you find it is 3:37 am. Your That gives you 2 hours to escape and still have enough time to grab your calculator and charger from your dorm on Commons and perhaps a quick munchie run.

All the doors are locked, will you find your way out in time?
