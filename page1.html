<pre><h1>One night late into an intense study sesh at Stevenson Library...</h1>
It's even quieter than usual. That's weird...

No one furiously typing away 40 pages worth of papers in one night
No rustle of hundreds of pages of notes for the next gen bio exam
No frustrated groans and defeated sighs marking the passing minutes


No signs of anyone else at all.

What time is it? Oh...phone's dead....
The clock on the wall reads <strong>5:17 am</strong>.

Hmmm...
You have an 8:10 am--can't miss it it again.
You've slept through the class <em>way</em> too many times already.

You need to retrieve your calculator and charger from your dorm on Commons before class.
So,

exactly <strong>2 hours</strong> to escape with enough time to reach Commons and back.

...and perhaps a quick munchie run for some much needed coffee.

All the doors are locked, will you find your way out in time?
