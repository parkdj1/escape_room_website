# Escape Room -- Vandy Stevenson

I decided to learn web development with Html, CSS, Javascript during my time at home, summer of 2020, and developed this website as a way to practice what I was learning. The idea was inspired by some others who have developed escape rooms on google forms or Microsoft Powerpoint as a social-distancing compliant way to have fun with friends.

To play, download all of the files and open the welcome page file in your browser of choice. Enjoy!
